# VIP Rush

We participate in the semi-annual VIP Rush which is a poster information event for prospective students.  It is typically held on the first Tuesday after registration opens. You can find details about about the next event [here](https://vip.gatech.edu/rsvp-upcoming-vip-rush). Please stop by to talk to our students about what we do and how you can get involved!
