## Urban Microclimate using the Urban Weather Generator
### Introduction
This notebook is a documentation for the urban microclimate sub-team progress and outcomes.

### Repository Overview
- **Repository:** UWG repo
- **File:** .ipynb
  
### Notebook Summary
This notebook includes steps, process, and issues related to using the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) to have quick urban microclimate results. Below are the summarized steps of the process.
1. Test run the UWG script using a selected .epw file retrieved from https://climate.onebuilding.org/.
2. Perform sensitivity analysis test to select the most affective UWG inputs.
3. Collect the exact values for the selected inputs in the selected .epw file location (Using Grasshopper script).
4. Run the UWG with the correct inputs.
5. Compare the UWG .epw results with the initial .epw file.
