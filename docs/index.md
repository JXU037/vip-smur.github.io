# Getting started

---

Welcome to the project page of the [VIP][VIP] team [Surrogate Modeling for Urban Regeneration](https://vip-smur.github.io/) at Georgia Tech. This course is led by Dr. Patrick Kastner, head of the [Sustainable Urban Systems Lab](https://sustain.arch.gatech.edu).

## üìù The Problem

Critics argue that the concept of sustainability merely maintains the status quo rather than fostering true regeneration. This research course challenges this view by developing software tools that go beyond environmental and economic concerns to [regenerate urban systems](https://unhabitat.org/topic/urban-regeneration) with a focus of empowering communities and decision-makers themselves.

Our models will help strengthen urban decision-making, enabling real-time testing of interventions. By involving all urban [stakeholders][stakeholders], we make regenerative cities tangible, actionable, and inclusive. Our work will address:

- Air quality / pollution / natural ventilation potential
- Microclimate assessment (outdoor thermal comfort, heat islands)
- Flood, stormwater / water runoff
- Mobility / walkability / transportation
- Global warming / climate change (heat waves)
- Urban decarbonization
- Urban building energy / district energy
- Environmental justice  

## üéØ Goals

Conventional environmental simulation approaches in urban design are time-consuming and often incompatible with the fast-paced decision-making processes. This project aims to revolutionize this outdated paradigm by developing surrogate models that accelerate simulations (typically via machine learning), thereby offering real-time feedback to urban decision-makers, such as architects, urban designers, and policymakers.
Our goal is to seamlessly integrate sustainability considerations into every step of urban decision-making processes by integrating our models with industry-standard CAD tools such as `Rhino` and `Revit` and others.

## ‚úÖ Interests and Prerequisites

We seek an interdisciplinary team of highly motivated students. Experience with `Python/C#`, `machine learning` and `simulation modeling` will be advantageous. We plan to form teams that consist of:

- Computer Science / Engineering (Civil, Environmental, Mechanical, etc.)
- (Applied) Industrial and Systems Engineering
- Architecture & Urban Design
- Public Policy
- Etc.

If your major is not mentioned above, please contact us to see if your background might be a good fit! We're happy to help.

[VIP]: https://vip.gatech.edu/vip-vertically-integrated-projects-program "The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program is a transformative approach to enhancing higher education by engaging undergraduate and graduate students in ambitious, long-term, large-scale, multidisciplinary project teams that are led by faculty. The program has been rigorously evaluated and refined over more than two decades.<br><br> In VIP, teams of undergraduate students ‚Äì from various years, disciplines and backgrounds ‚Äì work with faculty and graduate students in their areas of scholarship and exploration. Undergraduate students earn academic credit for their work and have direct experience with the innovation process, while faculty and graduate students benefit from the extended efforts of their teams."
