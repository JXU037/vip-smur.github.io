Welcome to the project page of the [VIP][VIP] team [Surrogate Modeling for Urban Regeneration](https://vip-smur.github.io/) (SMUR) at Georgia Tech. This course is led by Dr. Patrick Kastner, head of the [Sustainable Urban Systems Lab](https://sustain.arch.gatech.edu).

## üìù The Problem

Some critics argue that many urban sustainability efforts only maintain the status quo rather than fostering true [urban regeneration](https://unhabitat.org/topic/urban-regeneration). This research course challenges this view by developing software tools that empower communities and urban decision-makers.

Our models will enable urban decision-making by enabling real-time testing of interventions. By involving a multitude of urban [stakeholders][stakeholders], we make regenerative cities tangible, actionable, and inclusive. Our work will address:

- Air quality, pollution, natural ventilation potential
- Microclimate assessment (outdoor thermal comfort, heat islands)
- Flood, stormwater, water runoff
- Mobility, walkability, transportation
- Global warming, climate change (heat waves)
- Urban decarbonization
- Urban building energy, district energy
- Environmental justice  

## üéØ Goals

Conventional environmental simulation approaches in urban design are time-consuming and often incompatible with fast-paced decision-making processes. This VIP aims to address this outdated paradigm by developing surrogate models that accelerate simulations (typically via machine learning) that offer real-time feedback to urban decision-makers, such as architects, urban designers, and policymakers.

Our goal is to seamlessly integrate sustainability considerations into every step of urban decision-making processes by integrating our models with industry-standard CAD tools such as `Rhino` and `Revit` and others.

## ‚úÖ Interests and Prerequisites

We seek an interdisciplinary team of highly motivated students. Experience with `Python/C#`, `machine learning` and `simulation modeling` will be advantageous. We plan to form teams that consist of:

- Computer Science / Engineering (Civil, Environmental, Mechanical, etc.)
- (Applied) Industrial and Systems Engineering
- Architecture & Urban Design
- Public Policy
- Etc.
