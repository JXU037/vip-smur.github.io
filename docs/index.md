Welcome to the project page of the [VIP][VIP] team [Surrogate Modeling for Urban Regeneration](https://vip-smur.github.io/) (SMUR) at Georgia Tech. 
This course is led by Dr. Patrick Kastner, head of the [Sustainable Urban Systems Lab](https://sustain.arch.gatech.edu).

## üìù The Problem

Many performance-related decisions in architectural and urban design happen too late in the decision-making process to ensure they suit the clients' purposes. 
We believe this hinders true [urban regeneration][urban regeneration]. 
This research course challenges this status quo by developing software tools that empower communities and urban decision-makers.

{% include 'macleamy.md' %} 

Our models will enable urban decision-making by enabling real-time testing of interventions. 
By involving a multitude of urban [stakeholders][stakeholders], we make regenerative cities tangible, actionable, and inclusive. 
Our work will address:

- Air quality, pollution, natural ventilation potential
- Microclimate assessment (outdoor thermal comfort, urban heat islands)
- Flood, stormwater, water runoff
- Mobility, walkability, transportation
- Global warming, climate change (heat waves)
- Urban building energy, district energy, decarbonization modeling
- Etc.

## üéØ Goals

Conventional environmental simulation approaches in urban design are time-consuming and often incompatible with fast-paced decision-making processes. 
This VIP aims to address this outdated paradigm by developing [surrogate models][surrogate models] that accelerate simulations (typically via machine learning) that offer real-time feedback to urban decision-makers, such as architects, urban designers, and policymakers.

Our goal is to seamlessly integrate sustainability considerations into every step of urban decision-making processes by integrating our models with industry-leading CAD tools such as `Rhino` and `Revit`, `QGIS`, `ArcGIS`, and making them usable even in the browser.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

We seek an interdisciplinary team of highly motivated students. 
Experience with `Python`, `C#`, `JavaScript`, `machine learning`, and `simulation modeling` will be advantageous. 
Our sub-teams typically are interdisciplinary and consist of students from:

- Computer Science / Engineering (Civil, Environmental, Mechanical, etc.)
- (Applied) Industrial and Systems Engineering
- Architecture & Urban Design
- City & Regional Planning
- Applied Math & Physics
- Public Policy
- Etc.

If your major is not mentioned, please [contact us](mailto:patrick.kastner@gatech.edu) to see if your background might be a good fit. 
We're happy to help!
